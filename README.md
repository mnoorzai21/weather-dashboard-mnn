# weather-dashboard-mnn
This project is a weather app that the user can search for a city that they want to travel to. This shows the current weather of the searched city and the next five days' weather. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are being used on this website. I have learned Javascript functions, fetch requests, server APIs, and how to request specific data from the URL.
